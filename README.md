Practicing Sunday morning with a somewhat fresh cup of coffee while watching G2 hopefully win the LEC summer finals.  Watched this video -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKOT5LcouzQ&t=185s -
for inspiration and really was focusing on how to integrate JS into my code. 

Using getElementbyID, onClick, and what innerHTML means was a good takeaway from this SUPER short bit of work.
